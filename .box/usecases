Lists of lists of lists are possible by simply putting it

	list of lists:::[
	[a b c]
	inner:::[
	1
	2
	3
	] inner
	:::[
	foo
	bar
	] anonymous inner
	]

	 which enables simple annotations like "inner" as help for the reader. This is possible, since keys have no meaning within lists. The above notation would result in the structure 
	 [["a", "b", "c"], ["1", "2", "3"], ["foo", "bar"]]
